## Why do I need a website?

Your website is a vital part of how your customers experience your business. Most mobile phone users find businesses by using search engines from their phones. Many times your website is the first contact new clients will have with your business, so don't you want to make a good first impression?

## I can do it myself...

Yes, you can! With modern tools, it has been easier than ever to launch a do-it-yourself website. Unfortunately, these services often end up being expensive and time-consuming to maintain, while still less effective than a professionally designed website.

## Why choose Deadhead.Design?

Some marketing companies will quickly sell you a one-size-fits-all website design they have developed for businesses in your industry. I think your business is unique and, as such, requires unique treatment to reach its full potential.

Deadhead Design's custom web design and development service will focus on your business's needs, developing a fully custom design and unique feature set for your website. This allows you to put your best foot forward, attracting customers with local SEO and becoming the cornerstone of your online presence.

But, the story doesn't stop there. The web is no longer purely informational. Your clients now expect to be able to interact with your business on your website. Give users a great experience with appointment scheduling, online stores, live chat, or whatever feature you need to provide them that great service you're known for.

## Technologies

We use a wide range of technologies when developing each website and web application. From languages like HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, Javascript, Gatsby, and React; to systems like WordPress, Shopify, and more. I guarantee we will develop a solution that meets your needs and works great with your existing technologies.

## Responsive Web Design

Responsive web development is the practice of building a website to ensure it is easily viewed and used on any device or browser. This is vital. As of 2018, more than half of all web traffic is on mobile phones, increasing every year.

I will spare you the technical details. Simply put, it's impossible to deliver the exact same experience to every user. Instead of trying to, we design websites so that as the device changes, the website can respond to those changes. This ensures every user gets the absolute best experience they can.

## Content Management Systems

Ready to get hands-on with your new website? With custom content management systems, it's easy to update information, manage events, post updates, share pictures, and more.

Unlike complex and confusing systems you might have experience with, our system only shows you what you need. How? We build it just for your business. If you have an old favorite, such as WordPress or Drupal, we can use that too. In some cases, we can develop your new website right on top of the existing content management system.

## Hosting

Don't worry about hosting or maintaining your site either. Unlike some developers, Deadhead doesn't turn over your info and move on. We will gladly manage the web hosting and updates for you. Including monitoring cybersecurity and keeping backups, ensuring nothing will slow you down.

## Search Engine Optimization

Your website looks great and is useful, but if no one sees it, then what's the point? Over 50% of all traffic will come from organic searches on platforms like Google and Bing, and less than 1% of users click to the second page of results. Thoughtful SEO will ensure your website is on the first page of Google, where your customers are looking for you. Good Search Engine Optimization starts on day one to ensure your site's content and development structure will land you at the top.
