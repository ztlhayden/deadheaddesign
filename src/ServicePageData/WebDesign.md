Your website is a vital part of how your customers experience your business. Most mobile phone users find businesses by using search engines from their phones. Many times your website is the first contact new clients will have with your business, so don't you want to make a good first impression?

With modern tools, it has been easier than ever to launch a do-it-yourself website. Unfortunately, these services often end up being expensive and time-consuming to maintain, while still less effective than a professionally designed website.

Deadhead Design's custom web design and development service will focus on your business's needs, developing a fully custom design and unique feature set for your website. This allows you to put your best foot forward, attracting customers with local SEO and becoming the cornerstone of your online presence.

But, the story doesn't stop there. The web is no longer purely informational. Your clients now expect to be able to interact with your business on your website. Give users a great experience with appointment scheduling, online stores, live chat, or whatever feature you need to provide them that great service you're known for.

We use a wide range of technologies when developing each website and web application. From languages like HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, Javascript, Gatsby, and React; to systems like WordPress, Shopify, and more. I guarantee we will develop a solution that meets your needs and works great with your existing technologies.

Responsive web development is the practice of building a website to ensure it is easily viewed and used on any device or browser. This is vital. As of 2018, more than half of all web traffic is on mobile phones, increasing every year. Simply put, it's impossible to deliver the exact same experience to every user. Instead of trying to, we design websites so that as the device changes, the website can respond to those changes. This ensures every user gets the absolute best experience they can.

Ready to get hands-on with your new website? We can help you select the perfect CMS for your site. If you have an old favorite, such as WordPress or Drupal, we can use that too. In some cases, we can develop your new website right on top of the existing content management system.
